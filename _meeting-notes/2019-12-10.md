## :mega: Update (Done, Shipped, Made Progress)
> To be reviewed Async

- ==@raulk==
- ==@daviddias==
  - Planned Onboarding Hack Week https://docs.google.com/document/d/18P1EfbJ3T4SkafNur7u9uI7WqP8pReP340YXvy8EMAA/edit#
  - Kicked off the Quarter Retrospective https://github.com/ipfs/testground/issues/220
  - Unpacked Test Plan 4 for @jimpick https://github.com/ipfs/testground/issues/96#issuecomment-562877707
  - Reviewed PRs
  - Unblocked @hacdias
  - Created issue templates https://github.com/ipfs/testground/pull/229
  - Groomed the Kanban
- ==@stebalien==
  - Did not finish the sidecar work
  - Jitter PR was merged
  - Did not finish the DHT test refactor.
      - Added a method to the DHT to bootstrap and _wait_ to finish.
      - [WIP] Started working on making the test realistic.
          - Issue: We were dialing everyone.
          - Issue: Dialing in a ring then bootstrapping will still dial everyone (because the DHT is a ring).
          - Solution: Don't dial everyone.
          - Solution: Use bootstrap peers to avoid connecting to every peer on bootstrap.
          - Solution: [TODO] Stagger the bootstrap step so peers bootstrap into an existing DHT instead of a fresh DHT.
- ==@jimpick==
    - Test Plan 4
        - Discussed ideas with David
        - David "unpacked" it https://github.com/ipfs/testground/issues/96#issuecomment-562877707
        - Working on further "unpacking" - a new "docs" directly under the testplan with a complete "brain-dump" / plan - work-in-progress, will ask for review on PR tomorrow https://github.com/ipfs/testground/pull/232
    - Test SideCar and demonstrate how to use it (docs or recorded demo)
        - I reviewed the Sidecar code, but didn't write a new test yet that uses it
    - Tested Anton's Infra PR
- ==@nonsense==
    - Got the `daemon` PR merged
    - Got the initial `infra` PR (`terraform` and `ansible` playbooks) reviewed and merged
    - Took over infra from Jim
    - Added redirect from http://testground.ipfs.team to github.com/ipfs/testground :) testground.ipfs.team is now managed within the Testground team
- ==@hacdias==
    - Added Dependency Tree tracking ([PR](https://github.com/ipfs/testground/pull/204))
    - Added initial tests for Chewing Large Datasets plan ([PR](https://github.com/ipfs/testground/pull/58))
    - Added daemon support for large datasets plan, as well as two full tests ([PR](https://github.com/ipfs/testground/pull/223))
    - Working on
        - MFS Files API
            - https://github.com/ipfs/interface-go-ipfs-core/pull/54
            - https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/6786



## :question: Questions (Blockers, Technical Design needs)
> We only have 30 mins for this section, use your time wisely

- @raul feedback on the Critical Path Tree Feedback
  - Break Infra into
    - Infra structure
      - 
    - Infra as a Service
      - 1st and 2nd sticky
  - AI(David) Augment DHT Plan with test cases for the "critical patches made to the DHT"
    - https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-kad-dht/issues/345

- @anton We've hit Docker Swarm scalability issues
  - @raul - try simpler docker image - just `ping`
  - @jim - try parallelism config of docker swarm (start with fewer replicas)

## :dart: Next

~~### OKRs for the Quarter~~ #1 Goal: Unblock go-ipfs 0.5.0
~~https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ipfs/testground/master/docs/img/Q4OKRs.png~~
~~### Top 3 things to get done this week~~

We are putting aside the OKRs for the time being and instead **focus on the #1 Goal: Unblock go-ipfs 0.5.0**. This goal has a very clear list of things that need to ship:

- [ ] Instrument go-libp2p so that the DHT operations are observable and traced in a Distributed Context (owner: @raulk)
- [ ] Add support to Traffic Shaping & Network Configuration to TestGround (owner: @Stebalien)
- [ ] Expand the TestGround Infrastructure so that it can run multiple thousands of nodes (owner: @nonsense)
- [ ] Creation of a TestGround Dashboard that can aid the developers of go-ipfs & go-libp2p to grok the results outputted by every node in a TestGround run (owner: @daviddias)
- [ ] Keep on iterating the DHT Test Plan (@owner: @daviddias)
- [ ] Design blueprint for multi-version tests (aka test ensembles) (owner: @raulk)

Full list can be at https://github.com/ipfs/testground/issues/196



### Assignments

- ==@raulk==
    - (HIGH PRIO, working on this now) Outline candidate solutions and trade-offs for libp2p deep traceability.
    - Proof of concept of 3 different solutions that Raúl is thinking of (OpenTracing with mock tracer, diagnostics context, go-log tracer).
- ==@daviddias==
  - Host Testground Hack week
  - Review https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-kad-dht/issues/345 and augment the DHT test plan with it
  - Review @jimpick PR https://github.com/ipfs/testground/pull/232
- ==@nonsense==
  - Measure the memory footprint of a go-libp2p node that runs 1000 find peer queries on the mainnet
  - Use that measure to calculate how many nodes can be run in each AWS instance
  - Calculate the right number of machines needed for a cluster to run 10000 libp2p nodes
  - Enhance the Testground experience by removing the overhead of running a plan (devs should not have to worry about infra). Running a plan should be done in one command
      - @nonsense - this assumes we run a service on AWS and solve issues like:
          - https://github.com/ipfs/testground/issues/226
  - Get filebeat to only pump logs at the end of a run (so that it doesn't influence the performance of the test)
      - @nonsense - this seems to be the lowest priority for the week, right?
- ==@hacdias==
  - Keep working on Chewing Strategies (https://github.com/ipfs/testground/issues/93)
      - Create an issue with the APIs that are missing from Core API and Go-ipfs-api
      - Should go-ipfs-api and core api have the same interface?
  - DHT refactory thingy (see @stebalien's) update bellow
  - Fix
    - https://github.com/ipfs/testground/issues/191
    - https://github.com/ipfs/testground/issues/124
    - https://github.com/ipfs/testground/issues/158
    - https://github.com/ipfs/testground/issues/34
- ==@jimpick==
  - Finish "brain dump" for Nodes Connectivity planning https://github.com/ipfs/testground/pull/232
  - Basic libp2p connectivity test + NAT (needs to be broken into sub-tasks)
  - Review current open bugs and tackle a set of them
    - Become the backlog bug champion warrior super master? "Will totally do that" <- ❤️
  - Fix
    - https://github.com/ipfs/testground/issues/173
    - https://github.com/ipfs/testground/issues/122
    - https://github.com/ipfs/testground/issues/131
- ==@stebalien==
  - Either finish the DHT Plan Refactor and/or outline the list of problems found + fixes to be made and then handoff to Henrique
  - Complete the sidecar work (NAT support through firewalls + Block inbound connections)
