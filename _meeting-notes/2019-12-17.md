## :mega: Update (Done, Shipped, Made Progress)
> To be reviewed Async

- ==@raulk==
  - Got done
    - Tracing galore in kad-dht.
    - Investigated bug in sync service.
    - Daemon refactor.
    - Design blueprints.
    - Paired with @hacdias to migrate the sync service to redis streams.
  - Didn't get done (and had commited to last week)
    - ...
  - Blocked
    - ...
- ==@daviddias==
  - Got done
    - Hosting Testground Onboarding Hack Week ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­
    - Lot's of project management duties (ton of prioritization discussions)
    - Reviewed https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-kad-dht/issues/345 and revisited the DHT test plan
      - https://github.com/ipfs/testground/issues/97#issuecomment-564617096
      - https://github.com/ipfs/testground/pull/260
    - PR reviews, including the one asked last week https://github.com/ipfs/testground/pull/232
  - Didn't get done (and had commited to last week)
    - None
  - Blocked
    - None
- ==@stebalien==
  - Got done
    - DHT Bugs
    - DHT test plan is now correct (and usually passes)
    - We now obey contexts in testground
    - Jitter PR has been merged
    - Documented how to use the sidecar
    - Testground now returns a non-zero exit code when a test fails.
    - Testground pretty-prints output.
    - In Progress:
        - IP address assignment
            - It works with one test case
            - Docker doesn't like re-using IP ranges for multpile test cases.
            - We _need_ this to create tests with more than 256 nodes (docker assigns /24 blocks)
        - Sidecar testcase
            - Part of the IP address assignment PR.
  - Didn't get done (and had commited to last week)
    - Blocking inbound connections
    - IP address assignment (with concurrent test runs)
  - Blocked
    - Nothing.
- ==@nonsense==
  - In progress
      - Investigated how to run multiple networks (default cluster network + secondary overlay network) on managed Kubernetes - https://github.com/ipfs/testground/issues/299
  - Got done
      - Added playbook for Terraform AWS EKS cluster
      - Updated docs on running Testground setup on Kubernetes on Digital Ocean
      - Measured scheduling and starting of pods on AWS, and DO - https://github.com/ipfs/testground/issues/227
      - Small improvements on Testground Go code (dockerhub support, REDIS_HOST env setup, IPAM config, etc.)
  - Didn't get done (and had commited to last week)
    - Measure the memory footprint of a go-libp2p node that runs 1000 find peer queries on the mainnet
    - Use that measure to calculate how many nodes can be run in each AWS instance
    - Calculate the right number of machines needed for a cluster to run 10000 libp2p nodes
    - Enhance the Testground experience by removing the overhead of running a plan (devs should not have to worry about infra). Running a plan should be done in one command
    - Get filebeat to only pump logs at the end of a run (so that it doesn't influence the performance of the test)
  - Blocked
    - Not sure how we're going to run multiple networks on Kubernetes yet, investigation continues...

## :question: Questions (Blockers, Technical Design needs)
> We only have 30 mins for this section, use your time wisely

- (@handle) QUESTION
- (@daviddias) Ask for @raulk, what is the state of https://github.com/ipfs/testground/issues/293
- (@daviddias) Ask for @nonsense, can you share your summary with the group https://github.com/ipfs/testground/issues/299#issuecomment-566639659 (thank you for writing it!). tl;dr;
  - Docker Swarm never worked with 1000 nodes (network creation failed, multiple errors).
  - Switched gears to k8s
  - More notes on the issue
- (@daviddias) 
  - Ask to the team: Let's stop using the word `should`. There are currently multiple items in the critical path that have received a "it should work" treatment. This is blurring our ability to recognize the risk and make more accurate predictions. Every time we do that, we are communicating that we are confident that something will work as expected. However, that is most often not the case than it is. The issue is that we are not outlining correctly:
    - how we are going to test that it works
    - what it happens if it does
    - what happens if it doesn't
    - what is the backup plan
  - Instead, default to create a issue (or add a comment to the one that already exists) that has an answer to all the questions above.

## :dart: Next

~~### OKRs for the Quarter~~ #1 Goal: Unblock go-ipfs 0.5.0
~~https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ipfs/testground/master/docs/img/Q4OKRs.png~~
~~### Top 3 things to get done this week~~

We are putting aside the OKRs for the time being and instead **focus on the #1 Goal: Unblock go-ipfs 0.5.0**.  List of tasks can be found at https://github.com/ipfs/testground/issues/196

### Assignments

- ==@raulk==

  - nomad
- ==@daviddias==
  - If testground docker swarm runner for 200 nodes cluster goal is achieved, then:
    - Review Testground onboarding materials 
    - Onboard go-ipfs/go-libp2p contributors 
  - Write my async retrospective https://github.com/ipfs/testground/issues/220
- ==@nonsense==
    - Run 10k testplan instances that have access to two networks - a control and secondary overlay network, ideally in a developer-friendly way - https://github.com/ipfs/testground/issues/299
- ==@hacdias==
  - dht test plan with raul
- ==@jimpick==
  - testing with Docker Swarm (small number of containers) + sidecar + DHT (perhaps using TCP test plan for pre-flight)
- ==@stebalien==
  - k8s and sidecar with steven
